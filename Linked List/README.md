# **Linked List**
Linked lists are a fundamental data structure that allows efficient storage and manipulation of data


## **Explanation**

1. ### **Linear Linked List**
    A linear linked list consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. The menu-driven code for a linear linked list typically includes options to perform operations such as inserting a node, deleting a node, searching for a specific value, displaying the list, and exiting the program.



2. ### **Doubly Linked List**
    A doubly linked list extends the concept of a linear linked list by including an additional pointer in each node, pointing to the previous node. The menu-driven code for a doubly linked list provides options for inserting, deleting, searching, displaying, and exiting, similar to a linear linked list. However, due to the presence of backward links, the code must handle operations involving both forward and backward traversal.



3. ### **Circular Linked List**
    In a circular linked list, the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure. The menu-driven code for a circular linked list offers operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, displaying, and exiting. Care must be taken to correctly handle the circular nature of the list when performing operations like traversal or deletion.



4. ### **Circular Doubly Linked List**
    A circular doubly linked list combines the properties of a circular linked list and a doubly linked list. Each node has a forward and backward pointer, and the last node connects back to the first node. The menu-driven code for a circular doubly linked list allows operations like insertion, deletion, searching, displaying, and exiting, taking into account both forward and backward traversal.



5. ### **Dynamic Linear Queue using Linked List**
    A dynamic linear queue implemented using a linked list provides a queue data structure with dynamic memory allocation. The menu-driven code for this structure includes options for enqueueing (adding) elements, dequeuing (removing) elements, displaying the queue, checking if it is empty, checking if it is full, and exiting.



6. ### **Dynamic Stack using Linked List**
    A dynamic stack implemented using a linked list allows the creation of a stack with dynamic memory allocation. The menu-driven code for a dynamic stack provides options for pushing (adding) elements, popping (removing) elements, displaying the stack, checking if it is empty, checking if it is full, and exiting.

 


In each of these menu-driven linked list codes, you willbe presented with a menu of options to choose from, and the corresponding operations are performed based on their selections. This approach offers a convenient and user-friendly way to interact with linked lists and perform common operations without needing to write custom code for each functionality.


## **Setup Instructions**

1. Install Python
2. Verify Python Installation

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

3. Run the Python Script
    ```bash
    python filename.py
    ```

    Note: Replace `filename.py` with the name of the python file which is to be executed.
